Open index.html in a browser and navigate between other webpages via the navbar.

NOTE: Some features are only partially implemented and there are some bugs that need resolution too.


FUTURE WORK

- Test-Driven Development (ideally Jest)

- Authentication (ideally with 2FA)

- Configure into a Docker deployment to be further managed and orchestrated with Kubernetes.

- Data-driven content via a database (ideally MongoDB).

- Provide an admin portal.
