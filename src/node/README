In this current directory execute the following commands to install and run:

npm install

npm start


Upon start go to the following URL with a HTTP client:

http://localhost:3000/price?base=GBP&quote=USD

Price is returned via a console.log and web browser (requires a reload to display price via a HTTP client, which is a bug to research further).
